      <h2>Sophie's Story</h2>
         <p><strong>Sophie’s life changed forever</strong> when her husband, a dedicated serviceman, returned home from deployment. The man she loved had <strong>endured the unimaginable</strong>, and the weight of war left deep scars—ones that couldn’t be seen but were <strong>impossible to ignore.</strong> His struggle with severe mental health challenges meant that Sophie not only became his carer but also the <strong>sole provider for their two young children.</strong></p>

         <p>Some days were harder than others. Between hospital visits, therapy sessions, and trying to <strong>maintain a sense of normality for her children,</strong> Sophie often found herself overwhelmed. Financial struggles added another layer of stress—balancing rent, energy bills, school supplies, and <strong>basic necessities felt like an uphill battle.</strong></p>

         <p>That’s when <strong>Freedom Feeds</strong> stepped in. Through food packages and essential grants, the organisation ensured that Sophie’s family <strong>never had to worry about their next meal</strong> or keeping their home warm during winter. It wasn’t just about financial support—it was about <strong>dignity, relief, and knowing that someone cared.</strong></p>

         <p>Thanks to <strong>Freedom Feeds</strong>, Sophie’s family has regained a sense of stability. <strong>While the challenges remain, they no longer have to face them alone.</strong></p>
