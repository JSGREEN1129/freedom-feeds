      <h2>Sophie's Story</h2>
      <p><strong>Sophie’s</strong> life changed forever when her husband, a dedicated serviceman, returned home from deployment. The man she loved had <strong>endured the unimaginable</strong>, and the weight of war left deep scars—ones that couldn’t be seen but were <strong>impossible to ignore</strong>. His struggle with severe mental health challenges meant that Sophie not only became his carer but also the <strong>sole provider for their two young children</strong>.</p>
      <p>Some days were harder than others. Between hospital visits, therapy sessions, and trying to maintain a sense of <strong>normality for her children</strong>, Sophie often found herself overwhelmed. <strong>Financial struggles</strong> added another layer of stress—balancing rent, energy bills, school supplies, and basic <strong>necessities felt like an uphill battle.</strong></p>
      <p>That’s when <strong>Freedom Feeds</strong> stepped in. Through <strong>food packages and essential grants</strong>, the organisation ensured that Sophie’s family never had to <strong>worry about their next meal or keeping their home warm during winter</strong>. It wasn’t just about financial support—it was about <strong>dignity, relief, and knowing that someone cared.</strong></p>
      <p>Thanks to <b>Freedom Feeds</b>, Sophie’s family has regained a sense of stability. <strong>While the challenges remain, they no longer have to face them alone.</strong></p>
